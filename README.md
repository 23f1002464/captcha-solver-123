# Captcha Solver Demo\n\nThis is a simple, single-file responsive HTML application designed to demonstrate a human-operated "captcha solver" interface. It allows users to input the text they see in a captcha image, either from a default local sample or a provided URL.\n\n## Features\n\n*   **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a consistent experience across various devices.\n*   **Image Loading:** Dynamically loads captcha images from a URL specified in the `?url=` query parameter or through a dedicated input field.\n*   **Default Sample:** Automatically displays `sample.png` if no external URL is provided.\n*   **User Input:** Provides a clear input field for users to type the captcha text.\n*   **Client-Side Verification:** For the `sample.png` image, the application performs client-side verification against a hardcoded solution. For external images, it accepts input but does not perform automated verification (as a true AI-powered solver would require server-side logic and machine learning).\n\n## How to Use\n\n1.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.\n2.  **Default Captcha:** The `sample.png` image will be displayed by default. Type "ADUR3" into the input field and click "Verify Captcha" to see a successful verification.\n3.  **Load Custom Captcha via URL:**\n    *   You can pass an image URL directly in the browser's address bar using the `?url=` query parameter. For example: `index.html?url=https://example.com/path/to/your/captcha.png`\n    *   Alternatively, paste an image URL into the "Image URL" input field and click "Load Image".\n4.  **Enter Solution:** Type the text you see in the displayed captcha image into the "Enter Captcha Text" field.\n5.  **Verify:** Click the "Verify Captcha" button. The application will indicate whether the input for `sample.png` is correct or acknowledge input for custom images.\n\n## Project Structure\n\n*   `index.html`: The main single-file HTML application, including CSS (via CDN) and JavaScript.\n*   `sample.png`: The default captcha image provided.\n*   `README.md`: This file.\n*   `LICENSE`: The MIT License for this project.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n*   **HTML5:** For the basic page structure.\n*   **Tailwind CSS (CDN):** For utility-first styling and responsive design.\n*   **JavaScript:** For dynamic content loading, user interaction, and client-side logic.\n
